## Abstract
This work is realized as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization proposed by the Johns Hopkins University. The aim of the project is to build a prediction model by using the [programming language R](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

## Context of the project
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the data come from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this project is to predict these 5 classes by using the accelerometers data.
